# Haloverse Network


## Summary

Haloverse Network is a simple stat-tracker for competitive Halo 5 or Halo Wars 2 Xbox gamers. The site allows a user to submit their Xbox gamertag to view their current Halo game-statistics. The site features navigation tabs for a user to access a variety of Halo meta-data and information. 

This app uses the [Halo Public API](https://developer.haloapi.com/docs/services/).

##  Installation

1.  Clone this repo to your local machine
2.  Run npm install to download all necessary dependencies

5.  Enter any Xbox gamertag in the input field and hit `Enter`. Here are some gamertags for you to try:

Note: Too many frequent gamertag submissions may cause the request to time out.
